# Abstract 

A new choice model is derived, rooted in the framework of *Random Regret Minimization* (RRM). 
The proposed model postulates that when choosing, people anticipate and aim to minimize regret. 
Whereas previous regret-based discrete choice-models assume that *regret is experienced with respect to only the best of foregone alternatives*, the proposed model assumes that *regret is potentially experienced with respect to each foregone alternative that performs well*. 
In contrast with earlier regret-based discrete-choice approaches, this model can be estimated using readily available discrete-choice software packages. 
The proposed model is contrasted theoretically and empirically with its natural counterpart, Random Utility Maximizationâ€™s linear-additive MNL-model. 
Empirical comparisons on four revealed and stated travel choice datasets show a promising performance of the RRM-model.

# Introduction 

Anticipated regret is considered an important determinant of choice-behavior in a variety of disciplines, including :

- marketing (e.g. **Simonson, 1992**; **Zeelenberg & Pieters, 2007**), 
- microeconomics (e.g. **Loomes & Sugden, 1982**; **Sarver, 2008**), 
- psychology (e.g. **Zeelenberg, 1999**; **Connolly, 2005**), 
- the management sciences (e.g. **Savage, 1954**; **Bell, 1982**), 
- transportation (e.g., **Chorus et al., 2006a, b**).

RRM's contribution to discrete choice-modeling lies in its *ability to capture semi-compensatory behavior* (that is: RRM postulates that improvement of one attribute of an alternative not necessarily offsets an equally large decline in performance of another attribute) as well as *choice set-specific preferences*, within a model that is as tractable and parsimonious as RUM's linear-additive MNL-model.
