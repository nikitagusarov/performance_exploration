# Abstract 

This study is the first to compare random regret minimisation (RRM) and random utility maximisation (RUM) in freight transport application. 
This paper aims to compare RRM and RUMin a freight transport scenario involving negative shock in the reference alternative. 
Based on data from two stated choice experiments conducted among Swiss logistics managers, this study contributes to related literature by exploring for the first time the use of mixed logit models in the most recent version of the RRM approach. 
We further investigate two paradigm choices by computing elasticities and forecasting choice probability. 
We find that regret is important in describing the managersâ€™ choices. 
Regret increases in the shock scenario, supporting the idea that a shift in reference point can cause a shift towards regret minimisation. 
Differences in elasticities and forecast probability are identified and discussed appropriately.

# Introduction

Discrete choice modelling applications are generally based on (linear) random utility maximisation (RUM)  theory (**Thurstone 1927**; **Manski 1977**) and the derived logit model (**McFadden 1974**; **Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985**; **Train 2009**). 
However, growing evidence suggests that the choice paradigm based on RUM lacks behavioural realism in some occasions (**Hess, Stathopoulos, and Daly 2012**).

The *random regret minimisation* (RRM) approach to discrete choice modeling is a relatively new choice paradigm that relaxes the assumption of utility maximisation, remaining econometrically as parsimonious and tractable as its utilitarian counterpart, the RUM (**Chorus 2010**). 
The *RRM-based multinomial logit* (MNL) model is built on the notion that people aim to minimise regret rather than maximise utility when choosing; in this situation, regret is defined as what a person experiences when a non-chosen alternative performs better than a chosen one in terms of one or more attributes.
