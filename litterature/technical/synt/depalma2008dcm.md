# Abstract

This paper examines the cross-fertilizations of random utility models with the study of decision making under risk and uncertainty. 
We start with a description of the expected utility (EU) theory and then consider deviations from the standard EU frameworks, involving the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox, inter alia.
We then discuss how the resulting non-EU framework can be modeled and estimated within the framework of discrete choices in static and dynamic contexts. 
Our objectives in addressing risk and ambiguity in individual choice contexts are to understand the decision choice process and to use behavioral information for prediction, prescription, and policy analysis.

# Introduction

This paper addresses the following questions: 

- What is the degree of substitution/overlap and coherence between the random utility models and the non-expected utility models? 
- Under which circumstances is there a need to extend the standard expected utility theory toward non-expected utility theories?
