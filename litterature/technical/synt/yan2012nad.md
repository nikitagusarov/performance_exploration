# Abstract 

Over the past few decades, numerous optimization-based methods have been proposed for solving the classification problem in data mining. 
Classic optimization-based methods do not consider *attribute interactions toward classification*. 
Thus, a novel learning machine is needed to provide a better understanding on the nature of classification when the in-teraction among contributions from various attributes cannot be ignored. 
The interactions can be described by a non-additive measure while the Choquet integral can serve as the mathematical tool to aggregate the values of attributes and the corresponding values of a non-additive measure. 
As a main part of this research, a new *nonlinear classification method with non-additive measures is proposed*. 
Experimental results show that applying *non-additive measures on the classic optimization-based models improves the classification robustness and accuracy* compared with some popular classification methods. 
In addition, motivated by well-known Support Vector Machine approach, we transform the primal optimization-based nonlinear classification model with the signed non-additive measure into its dual form by ap-plying Lagrangian optimization theory and Wolfes dual programming theory. 
As a result, $2n â€“ 1$ parameters of the signed non-additive measure can now be approximated with $m$ (number of records) Lagrangian multipliers by applying necessary conditions of the primal classification problem to be optimal. 
This method of parameter approximation is a breakthrough for solving a non-additive measure practically when there are a relatively small number of training cases available. 
Furthermore, the *kernel-based learning method engages the nonlinear classifiers to achieve bet-ter classification accuracy*. 
The research produces practically deliverable nonlinear models with the non-additive meas-ure for classification problem in data mining when interactions among attributes are considered.
