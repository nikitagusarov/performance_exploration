    abstract = { This paper presents an overview of model properties and empirical evidence related to the recently introduced discrete choice paradigm of random regret minimization (RRM). The RRM approach to discrete choice modelling provides an alternative to the conventional, linear-additive random utility maximization (RUM)-based approach which has dominated the field since its inception. Section of Transport and Logistics RRM models postulate that when choosing, decision-makers are concerned with avoiding the situation where one or more non-chosen alternatives perform better than a chosen one in terms of one or more attributes. From this central behavioural premise, semi-compensatory decision-making and choice set composition effects like the compromise effect emerge as RRM model features. Being as parsimonious as RUM's linear-additive multinomial logit model, RRM features logit choice probabilities and is easily estimable using conventional discrete choice software packages. This paper ties together the main insights and results from a number of recent studies that have explored RRM's model properties and empirically tested RRM-based models Delft University of Technology, based on a range of revealed and stated choice data sets. As such, the paper allows for an early assessment of RRM's potential and its limitations as a model of discrete (travel) choice behaviour. }

    abstract = "The current paper proposes the use of the multivariate skew-normal distribution function to accommodate non-normal mixing in cross-sectional and panel multinomial probit (MNP) models. The combination of skew-normal mixing and the MNP kernel lends itself nicely to estimation using Bhat’s (2011) maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach. Simulation results for the cross-sectional case show that our proposed approach does well in recovering the underlying parameters, and also highlights the pitfalls of ignoring non-normality of the continuous mixing distribution when such non-normality is present. At the same time, the proposed model obviates the need to assume a pre-specified parametric distribution for the mixing, and allows the estimation of a very flexible, but still parsimonious, mixing distribution form."

    abstract = "Generalized additive models (GAMs) are a generalization of generalized linear models (GLMs) and constitute a powerful technique which has successfully proven its ability to capture nonlinear relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable in many domains. In this paper, GAMs are proposed as base classifiers for ensemble learning. Three alternative ensemble strategies for binary classification using GAMs as base classifiers are proposed: (i) GAMbag based on Bagging, (ii) GAMrsm based on the Random Subspace Method (RSM), and (iii) GAMens as a combination of both. In an experimental validation performed on 12 data sets from the UCI repository, the proposed algorithms are benchmarked to a single GAM and to decision tree based ensemble classifiers (i.e. RSM, Bagging, Random Forest, and the recently proposed Rotation Forest). From the results a number of conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the use of an ensemble of GAMs instead of a single GAM always leads to improved prediction performance. Secondly, GAMrsm and GAMens perform comparably, while both versions outperform GAMbag. Finally, the value of using GAMs as base classifiers in an ensemble instead of standard decision trees is demonstrated. GAMbag demonstrates performance comparable to ordinary Bagging. Moreover, GAMrsm and GAMens outperform RSM and Bagging, while these two GAM ensemble variations perform comparably to Random Forest and Rotation Forest. Sensitivity analyses are included for the number of member classifiers in the ensemble, the number of variables included in a random feature subspace and the number of degrees of freedom for GAM spline estimation."

    abstract = {Summary A large number of measures have been developed for evaluating the performance of classification rules. Some of these have been developed to meet the practical requirements of specific applications, but many others—which here we call “classification accuracy” criteria—represent different ways of balancing the different kinds of misclassification which may be made. This paper reviews classification accuracy criteria. However, the literature is now so large and diverse that a comprehensive list, covering all the measures and their variants, would probably be impossible. Instead, this paper embeds such measures in general framework, spanning the possibilities, and draws attention to relationships between them. Important points to note are, firstly, that different performance measures, by definition, measure different aspects of performance; secondly, that one should therefore carefully choose a measure to match the objectives of one's study; and, thirdly, that empirical comparisons between instruments measuring different aspects are of limited value.},

    abstract = "The choice of the functional form of the frontier into a stochastic frontier model is typically neglected in applications and canonical functions are usually considered. This paper introduces a semiparametric approach for stochastic frontier estimation that extends previous works based on pseudo-likelihood estimators allowing flexibility in model selection and capability of imposing monotonicity and concavity constraints. For these purposes the present work introduces a generalized additive framework that moreover permits to model the influence of contextual/environmental factors to the hypothesized production process by the relative extension given by generalized additive models for location, scale and shape. Through some Monte Carlo simulations and an application to European agricultural data the flexibility of the proposed framework in analyzing efficiency is illustrated."

    abstract = "Many researchers use categorical data analysis to recover individual consumption preferences, but the standard discrete choice models require restrictive assumptions. To improve the flexibility of discrete choice data analysis, we propose a nonparametric multiple choice model that applies the penalized likelihood method within the random utility framework. We show that the deterministic component of the random utility function in the model is a cubic smoothing spline function. The method subsumes the conventional conditional logit model (McFadden, 1973, in: Zarembka, P., (Ed.), Frontiers in Econometrics) as a special case. In this paper, we present the model, describe the estimator, provide the computational algorithm of the model, and demonstrate the model by applying it to nonmarket valuation of recreation sites."

In the application of the GAM, the link function involved is usually assumed to be a commonly used one without justification. Motivated by a real data example with binary response where the commonly used link function does not work, we propose a generalised additive models with unknown link function (GAMUL) for various types of data, including binary, continuous and ordinal. The proposed estimators are proved to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Semiparametric efficiency of the estimators is demonstrated in terms of their linear functionals. In addition, an iterative algorithm, where all estimators can be expressed explicitly as a linear function of Y, is proposed to overcome the computational hurdle for the GAM type model. Extensive simulation studies conducted in this paper show the proposed estimation procedure works very well. The proposed GAMUL are finally used to analyze a real dataset about loan repayment in China, which leads to some interesting findings."
