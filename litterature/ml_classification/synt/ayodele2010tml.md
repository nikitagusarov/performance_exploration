# Abstract / Introduction

Machine learning algorithms are organized into taxonomy, based on the desired outcome of the algorithm. 
Common algorithm types include:

- *Supervised learning* - where the algorithm generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. 
One standard formulation of the supervised learning task is the classification problem: the learner is required to learn (to approximate the behavior of) a function which maps a vector into one of several classes by looking at several input-output examples of the function.
- *Unsupervised learning* - which models a set of inputs: labeled examples are not available.
- *Semi-supervised learning* - which combines both labeled and unlabeled examples to generate an appropriate function or classifier.
- *Reinforcement learning* - where the algorithm learns a policy of how to act given an observation of the world. 
Every action has some impact in the environment, and the environment provides feedback that guides the learning algorithm.
- *Transduction* - similar to supervised learning, but does not explicitly construct a function: instead, tries to predict new outputs based on training inputs, training outputs, and new inputs.
- *Learning to learn* - where the algorithm learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience.

The performance and computational analysis of machine learning algorithms is a branch of statistics known as computational learning theory.

Machine learning is about designing algorithms that allow a computer to learn. 
Learning is not necessarily involves consciousness but learning is a matter of finding statistical regularities or other patterns in the data. 
Thus, many machine learning algorithms will barely resemble how human might approach a learning task. 
However, learning algorithms can give insight into the relative difficulty of learning in different environments.

# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is fairly common in classification problems because the goal is often to get the computer to learn a classification system that we have created.

These are the algorithms types:

- *Linear Classifiers* 
    * *Logical Regression*
    * *Na√Øve Bayes Classifier*
    * *Perceptron*
    * *Support Vector Machin*

- *Quadratic Classifiers*
- *K-Means Clustering*
- *Boosting*
- *Decision Tree* 
    * *Random Forest*

- *Neural networks*
- *Bayesian Networks*

# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning seems much harder: the goal is to have the computer learn how to do something that we don't tell it how to do.
