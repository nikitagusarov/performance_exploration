    abstract = "Travel Demand Forecasting, an essential tool to predict the future demand, is a four stage procedure which involves trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and traffic assignment, out of which, mode choice analysis plays vital role as it deals with predicting mode used by the travelers to reach their destination. Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is a traditional model adopted for mode choice analysis which has major limitation that the input variables need to have crisp values and hence should be measured accurately which consumes lot of time and resources. Moreover, decision of trip maker for choosing a mode involves human approximations which are not precisely captured by MNL model. This can be overcome by using artificial intelligence techniques like fuzzy logic for modeling mode choice behavior. Fuzzy logic try to harness the human knowledge which is often guided by approximations by accepting input values in linguistic terms. The fuzzy rule base comprises several IF-THEN rules which closely resemble human knowledge and decision-making. In this study, it was thus proposed to apply the concept of fuzzy logic for modeling mode choice and compare the results with traditional MNL model. For this purpose, a total of 5822 samples were collected in Port Blair city, India and data pertaining to input variables viz. in- vehicle travel time, out-vehicle travel time, travel cost and comfort index were considered for development of mode choice models. It was observed that the results obtained from fuzzy logic results gave better prediction accuracy in comparison to the traditional MNL model. Thus it can be concluded that the fuzzy logic models were better able to capture and incorporate the human knowledge and reasoning into mode choice behaviour. Further, developed fuzzy logic models are applied to evaluate selected transport policies to demonstrate the suitability of the developed fuzzy logic mode choice models."

    abstract={Estimation of binary choice models typically require that the econometric model satisfy the utility maximization hypothesis. The most widely used models for this purpose are the binary logit and probit models. To satisfy the utility maximization hypothesis the logit and probit models must make a priori assumptions regarding the underlying functional form of a representative utility function. Such a theoretical restriction on a statistical model without considering the underlying probabilistic structure of the observed data can leave the postulated estimable model statistically misspecified. Feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural networks (FFBANN) provide a potentially powerful semi-nonparametric method to avoid misspecifications. This paper shows that a single-hidden layer FFBANN can be interpreted as a logistic regression with a flexible index function. An empirical application is conducted using FFBANNs to model a contingent valuation study and estimate marginal effects and willingness-to-pay. Results are used for comparison with more traditional methods such as the binary logit and probit models.},

    abstract = {Supervised neural networks have been applied as a machine learning technique to identify and predict emergent patterns among multiple variables. A common criticism of these methods is the inability to characterize relationships among variables from a fitted model. Although several techniques have been proposed to \"illuminate the black box\", they have not been made available in an open-source programming environment. This article describes the NeuralNetTools package that can be used for the interpretation of supervised neural network models created in R. Functions in the package can be used to visualize a model using a neural network interpretation diagram, evaluate variable importance by disaggregating the model weights, and perform a sensitivity analysis of the response variables to changes in the input variables. Methods are provided for objects from many of the common neural network packages in R, including caret, neuralnet, nnet, and RSNNS. The article provides a brief overview of the theoretical foundation of neural networks, a description of the package structure and functions, and an applied example to provide a context for model development with NeuralNetTools. Overall, the package provides a toolset for neural networks that complements existing quantitative techniques for data-intensive exploration.},
