## Abstract

Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. 
Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence.
However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. 
Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. 
Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. 
This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. 
The goals of this study are to :

1. identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; 
2. identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; 
3. assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. 

The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.

## Introduction

Recommender systems (RSs) are used to help users find new items or services, such as books, music, transportation or even
people, based on information about the user, or the recommended item ( Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2005 ). 
These systems also play an important role in decision-making, helping users to maximize profits ( Chen, Hsu, Chen, & Hsu, 2008 ) or minimize risks ( Bouneffouf, Bouzeghoub, & Gancarski, 2013 ). 
Today, RSs are used in many information-based companies such as Google ( Liu, Dolan, & Pedersen, 2010 ), Twitter ( Ahmed et al., 2013 ), LinkedIn ( Rodriguez, Posse, & Zhang, 2012 ), and Netflix ( Steck, 2013 ). 
The field of RS has its origins in the mid-1990s with the introduction of Tapestry ( Goldberg, Nichols, Oki, & Terry, 1992 ), the first RS.

## Methodology

The search query was used on three popular academic search engines Scopus 1 , Web of Science 2 , and IEEEXplore 3 on August 26 th, 2016. 
The search returned 215 publication entries that were reviewed for quality. 
*Scopus* returned 196 studies, followed by *Web of Science* with 33 studies, and *IEEEXplore* with 31 studies. 
The titles of the studies were inspected to find duplicates among search engines. 
After that they were ready to be filtered by the exclusion criteria previously explained. 
The number of studies to be read in the systematic review decreased from 215 to 121 when filtered by the exclusion criteria.
Fifteen of the study entries were conference or proceeding descriptions and are excluded because they are not written scientific work.

The reading process focused on finding three types of information: one that relates to the RS being described (its classification), another that relates to the ML algorithm (its type, application domain, and performance metrics), and finally information about the source of the study (publication venue). 
The abstract and introduction of each paper was read, as well as the description of the proposed approach. 
Sometimes, when pieces of data were well described the entire section did not need to be read. 
The conclusion and future work sections of each study ware also read looking for open problems or research directions.

*In this paper we have an interesting overview on the number of models, techniques and algorithms by popularity: 121 wroks in total*
*This is of particular interest in our context.*

*This should be N1.5 after Japkowitcz among the references fo performance assessment !*
