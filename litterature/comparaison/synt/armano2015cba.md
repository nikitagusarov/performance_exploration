# A direct measure of discriminant and characteristic capability for classifier building and assessment

## Abstract

Performance measures are used in various stages of the process aimed at solving a classification problem. 
Unfortunately, most of these measures are in fact biased, meaning that they strictly depend on the class ratio â€“ i.e. on the imbalance between negative and positive samples. 
After pointing to the source of bias for the best known measures, novel unbiased mea- sures are defined which are able to capture the concepts of discriminant and characteristic capability. 
The combined use of these measures can give important information to researchers involved in machine learning or pattern recognition tasks, in particular for classifier performance assessment and feature selection.

## Introduction

How to assess the performance of a classifier and the importance of features are key issues in the process of classifier building and assessment. 
Although framed in the same process, in principle (and in practice) these research topics follow different perspectives. 
For this reason, short summaries concerning the corresponding issues and proposals will be separately illustrated.

*The focus in this paper is made on the confusion matrces.*
*Concecuently, it might be interesting to study it as an extention for Japkowicz's handbook.*
