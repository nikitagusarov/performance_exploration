    abstract = {Estimation of disaggregate mode choice models to estimate the ridership share on a proposed new (or improved) intercity travel service and to identify the modes from which existing intercity travelers will be diverted to the new or upgraded service constitutes a critical part of evaluating alternative travel service proposals to alleviate intercity travel congestion. This paper develops a new heteroscedastic extreme value model of intercity mode choice that overcomes the 'independence of irrelevant alternatives' (IIA) property of the commonly used multinomial logit model. The proposed model allows a more flexible cross-elasticity structure among alternatives than the nested logit model. It is also simple, intuitive and much less of a computational burden than the multinomial probit model. The paper discusses the non-IIA property of the heteroscedastic extreme value model and presents an efficient and accurate Gaussian quadrature technique to estimate the heteroscedastic model using the maximum likelihood method. The multinomial logit, alternative nested logit structures, and the heteroscedastic model are estimated to examine the impact of improved rail service on business travel in the Toronto-Montreal corridor. The nested logit structures are either inconsistent with utility maximization principles or are not significantly better than the multinomial logit model. The heteroscedastic extreme value model, however, is found to be superior to the multinomial logit model. The heteroscedastic model predicts smaller increases in rail shares and smaller decreases in non-rail shares than the multinomial logit in response to rail-service improvements. It also suggests a larger percentage decrease in air share and a smaller percentage decrease in auto share than the multinomial logit. Thus, the multinomial logit model is likely to provide overly optimistic projections of rail ridership and revenue, and of alleviation in inter-city travel congestion in general, and highway traffic congestion in particular. These findings point to the limitations of the multinomial logit and nested logit models in studying intercity mode choice behavior and to the usefulness of the heteroscedastic model proposed in this paper.},

    abstract={This paper considers the recently introduced family of reference models dedicated to non-ordered alternatives. The link function of reference models is that of the multinomial logit model (MNL) replacing the logistic cumulative distribution function (cdf) by other cdfs (e.g., Gumbel, Student). We determine all usual economic outputs (willingness-to-pay, elasticities,...). We also show that the IIA property generally does not hold for this family of models, because of their noninvariance to the alternative chosen as a reference. We estimate and compare five reference models to the MNL on a travel mode-choice survey: according to the chosen cdf, reference models lead to a better fit and retrieve consistent economic outputs estimations even when there is a high unobserved heterogeneity.},

    abstract = {The mixed or heterogeneous multinomial logit (MIXL) model has become popular in a number of fields, especially marketing, health economics, and industrial organization. In most applications of the model, the vector of consumer utility weights on product attributes is assumed to have a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution in the population. Thus, some consumers care more about some attributes than others, and the IIA property of multinomial logit (MNL) is avoided (i.e., segments of consumers will tend to switch among the subset of brands that possess their most valued attributes). The MIXL model is also appealing because it is relatively easy to estimate. Recently, however, some researchers have argued that the MVN is a poor choice for modelling taste heterogeneity. They argue that much of the heterogeneity in attribute weights is accounted for by a pure scale effect (i.e., across consumers, all attribute weights are scaled up or down in tandem). This implies that choice behaviour is simply more random for some consumers than others (i.e., holding attribute coefficients fixed, the scale of their error term is greater). This leads to a “scale heterogeneity” MNL model (S-MNL). Here, we develop a generalized multinomial logit model (G-MNL) that nests S-MNL and MIXL. By estimating the S-MNL, MIXL, and G-MNL models on 10 data sets, we provide evidence on their relative performance. We find that models that account for scale heterogeneity (i.e., G-MNL or S-MNL) are preferred to MIXL by the Bayes and consistent Akaike information criteria in all 10 data sets. Accounting for scale heterogeneity enables one to account for “extreme” consumers who exhibit nearly lexicographic preferences, as well as consumers who exhibit very “random” behaviour (in a sense we formalize below).},

    abstract = {Discrete choice models with error structures that are not independent and identically distributed have received enormous attention in the recent literature. A detailed synthetic study tests this type of model in a controlled case. With mixed logit and probit models as the study objects, calibration was implemented with the use of software available on the Internet. The controlled situation was built as a simulation laboratory, which generated databases with known parameters. The effects of various elements were analyzed: number of repetitions of the simulation, number of observations in the database, and how the use of Halton sequences improves the mixed logit calibration. The scale effects on the different models are also discussed. The results obtained in this specific context lead to some recommendations for future users of these powerful modeling tools. In particular, flexible structures require large sample sizes to calibrate the elements of the covariance matrix.}
