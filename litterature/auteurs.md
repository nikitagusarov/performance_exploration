## Sendhil Mullainathan

Sendhil Mullainathan is the Roman Family University Professor of Computation and Behavioral Science at Chicago Booth. 
His current research uses machine learning to understand complex problems in human behavior, social policy, and especially medicine, where computational techniques have the potential to uncover biomedical insights from large-scale health data. 
In addition to being a co-PI at the joint Berkeley-UChicago Laboratory for Systems Medicine, Sendhil is the cofounder of the computational medicine initiative, Nightingale.

In past work he has combined insights from economics and behavioral science with causal inference tools—lab, field, and natural experiments—to study social problems such as discrimination and poverty. 
Papers include: 

- the impact of poverty on mental bandwidth; 
- how algorithms can improve on judicial decision-making; 
- whether CEO pay is excessive; 
- using fictitious resumes to measure discrimination; 
- showing that higher cigarette taxes makes smokers happier; 
- modeling how competition affects media bias.

Choice behavior models provide a mathematically rigorous and empirically testable understanding of the choices people make. 
This opens the door towards quantifiable insights and predictions concerning human choice behavior in application domains as diverse as transport, energy, health, sociology, and marketing. 
Intriguingly, because they are so rigorously formalized, choice models also offer the potential to equip artificial intelligence with ‘human-inspired’ decision systems.

As a professor of choice behavior modeling, my research aim is to develop and empirically validate models of human decision-making that combine high levels of behavioral realism and mathematical tractability. 
In recent years, funded by highly competitive Veni (2010) and Vidi (2012) grants from the Netherlands science foundation NWO, my co-workers and I have developed choice models based on bounded rationality, including the now widely used random regret minimization model suite.
