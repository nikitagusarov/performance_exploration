# Abstract

This book extends and generalizes the contents of my previous book *Transportation Systems Engineering: Theory and Methods* published in 2001, updating both the theory and the application methods. 
In its attempt to address both general theory and practical methods, the book should be useful to readers with different needs and backgrounds. 
The various topics are presented, wherever possible, with a gradually increasing level of detail and complexity. 
Some sections can be used as the basis for beginning and advanced courses in transportation systems engineering and other disciplines, such as economics and regional science. 
Some sections deal with topics that are mainly of interest for specific applications or are still subjects of research; exclusion of such sections, which are marked with an asterisk, should not limit the understanding of later sections and chapters. 
The book is made up of ten chapters and an appendix.

Chapter 3 describes the theoretical basis and mathematical properties of random utility models; these are the general tools most widely adopted to model the travel behavior of transportation system users.

# Random Utility Theory

It should be said that random utility models are not the only behavioral models that can be used to represent transport-related choices. 
Other models proposed in the literature are based on choice mechanisms that violate one or more of the general hypotheses.
These models are often called **noncompensatory**, because they do not allow the compensation of negative attributes with positive ones or, more generally, trading off one attribute against another. 
Noncompensatory models are at present mostly research tools and are not widely used in practice.
Furthermore, it has been shown that a **properly specified random utility model can very often satisfactorily approximate the choice probabilities obtained with noncompensatory models**. (source ???)

- Basic Assumptions
    1. The generic decision-maker, in making a choice, considers mutually exclusive alternatives that constitute her choice set. 
    2. Decision-maker assigns to each alternative in his choice set a perceived utility or “attractiveness” and selects the alternative that maximizes this utility;
    3. The utility assigned to each choice alternative depends on a number of measurable characteristics, or attributes, of the alternative itself and of the decision-maker
    4. The utility assigned by decision-maker to alternative is not known with certainty by an external observer wishing to model the decision-maker’s choice behaviour.
