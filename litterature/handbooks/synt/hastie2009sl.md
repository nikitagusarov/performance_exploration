# Abstract

The field of Statistics is constantly challenged by the problems that science and industry brings to its door. 
In the early days, these problems often came from agricultural and industrial experiments and were relatively small in scope. 
With the advent of computers and the information age, statistical problems have exploded both in size and complexity. 
Challenges in the areas of data storage, organization and searching have led to the new field of "data mining"; statistical and computational problems in biology and medicine have created "bioinformatics". 
Vast amounts of data are being generated in many fields, and the statisticianâ€™s job is to make sense of it all: to extract important patterns and trends, and understand "what the data says". 
We call this learning from data.

The challenges in learning from data have led to a revolution in the statistical sciences. 
Since computation plays such a key role, it is not surprising that much of this new development has been done by researchers in other fields such as computer science and engineering.

The learning problems that we consider can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. 
In supervised learning, the goal is to predict the value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures; in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is to describe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures.

This book is our attempt to bring together many of the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical framework. 
While some mathematical details are needed, we emphasize the methods and their conceptual underpinnings rather than their theoretical properties. 
As a result, we hope that this book will appeal not just to statisticians but also to researchers and practitioners in a wide variety of fields.
