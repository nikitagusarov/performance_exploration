# Abstract

This book presents the most important methods for analyzing categorical data. 
It summarizes methods that have long played a prominent role, such as chi-squared tests. 
It gives special emphasis, however, to modeling techniques, in particular to logistic regression.

Chapters 3â€“7 introduce models for categorical responses. 
These models resemble regression models for continuous response variables. 
In fact, Chapter 3 shows they are special cases of a generalized class of linear models that also contains the usual normal-distribution-based regression models. 
The main emphasis in this book is on logistic regression models. 
Applying to response variables that have two outcome categories, they are the focus of Chapters 4 and 5. 
Chapter 6 presents extensions to multicategory responses, both nominal and ordinal. 
Chapter 7 introduces loglinear models, which analyze associations among multiple categorical response variables.

The models this book presents are generalized linear models. 
This broad class of models includes ordinary regression and ANOVA models for continuous responses as well as models for discrete responses. 
This chapter introduces generalized linear models for categorical and other discrete response data. 
The acronym GLM is shorthand for generalized linear model.

*Focus on binary data*

*GLM -> Logistic regression / Multinomial logistic regression*

**GLM :** (linear models)

- Regression 
    * Continuous variables 
- Classification
    * Categorical variables 
- *Other: ordered categorical*

*Are ther other linear models not GLM ? : ADL, separating hyperplanes, etc = not GLM models and are generalised through other algorithms (ex: SVMs)*

*Try to device another taxonomy based on generalisation algorithms - taking risk of existance of other generalisation techniques, some models have plurality of possible generalisations (ex: linear model that can be obtained by NN)*
