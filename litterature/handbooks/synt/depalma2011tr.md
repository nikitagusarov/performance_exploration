# Abstract

This Handbook, edited by de Palma, Lindsey, Quinet and Vickerman, is welcome for its novelty and originality. 
It is not the fi rst handbook on transport; there are other excellent volumes that focus on the transport sector or on subsectors within transport. 
These handbooks tend to provide a synthesis of the subject from the diff erent viewpoints of a range of disciplines including operational research, political science, engineering and management as well as economics. 
There are also handbooks which focus on particular branches of economics such as public economics, development economics and regional and urban economics.

Transport does not require a unique economics based on paradigms and mechanisms that diff er from other sectors of the economy. 
But transport is characterized by certain specific features.

- The first of these specific characteristics is the role of space. 
Transport is necessary because activities are spatially separated and this separation aff ects the economic analysis: it creates variable rents for land, it changes the laws of competition and it generates spatial inequalities.

- The second specific characteristic is time.

- The third characteristic of transport economics is the multiplicity of decisions that have to be made: choice of destination, transport mode, departure time and route, as well as long-run decisions such as residential location, workplace and vehicle ownership.

- The final characteristic is the relationship between the public and private sectors in the provision and management of transport.
