    abstract = { Existing common route choice models are based on random utility theory, which follows the maximum utility assumption. Recent intelligent transportation system applications have highlighted the need for better models of the behavioral processes involved in route choice decisions. Therefore, prediction of travelers' responses to uncertainty was analyzed. Route choice experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the feedback mechanism on decision making under uncertainty. The experimental results were compared with those from a model based on cumulative prospect theory and models based on learning approaches. It is shown that a traveler's sensitivity to travel time differences is lower when variances in travel times are higher. This better understanding of route choice behavior predicted by learning models may improve traffic predictions, as well as the design of traffic control mechanisms. }

    abstract = "We study various axioms of discrete probabilistic choice, measuring how restrictive they are, both alone and in the presence of other axioms, given a specific class of prior distributions over a complete collection of finite choice probabilities. We do this by using Monte Carlo simulation to compute, for a range of prior distributions, probabilities that various simple and compound axioms hold. For example, the probability of the triangle inequality is usually many orders of magnitude higher than the probability of random utility. While neither the triangle inequality nor weak stochastic transitivity imply the other, the conditional probability that one holds given the other holds is greater than the marginal probability, for all priors in the class we consider. The reciprocal of the prior probability that an axiom holds is an upper bound on the Bayes factor in favor of a restricted model, in which the axiom holds, against an unrestricted model. The relatively high prior probability of the triangle inequality limits the degree of support that data from a single decision maker can provide in its favor. The much lower probability of random utility implies that the Bayes factor in favor of it can be much higher, for suitable data."

    abstract = "Discrete choice studies, with rare exception, commonly assume that agents act as if sources of observed utility are captured through a linear in parameters and additive in attributes (LPAA) form, with some interactions. A growing number of transport (and other) choice studies have investigated one or more alternative processing rules adopted by agents in arriving at a choice, raising interest in how best to represent the utility expressions in a joint process and outcome choice model. Given the popular and appealing random parameter treatment of LPAA in mixed logit as a way of identifying non-systematic preference heterogeneity in a sample, this paper considers the possibility that we might be able to interact specific process heuristics with LPAA to uncover sources of systematic preference heterogeneity hidden in the standard LPAA form, and hence establish a link between the LPAA form and candidate process heuristics, offering a way to embellish and hence clarify the contributions to preference heterogeneity attributable to the presence of process heterogeneity. Specifically, we are interested in the extent to which there is a systematic relationship between the simple LPAA form and the more complex (albeit behaviourally realistic) process heuristics emerging in the transport literature which we call conditioning by random process heterogeneity (CRPH). In this paper, in addition to LPAA, we consider two process heuristics - Value Learning, and Relative Advantage Maximisation - with an overlay to account for risk attitudes, perceptual conditioning, and overt experience. The findings, using two data sets, suggest that empirically there exists a significant attribute-specific relationship between preference heterogeneity identified through specific process heuristics and through the LPAA assumption."

This model shares several desirable features of a set of models based on random regret minimisation (RRM), such as parsimony and choice set dependence. Although model fit differences are small, a preliminary comparison shows that the RAM model empirically outperforms the standard random utility maximisation (RUM) model, the RRM model, and a hybrid RUMRRM model in all eight data sets analysed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) measures derived from the RAM model.",

We show how a multinomial logit model framework may be used to model such decisions in a way that permits a tight integration of theory and econometrics. Conditions are given under which aggregate choice behavior in a population exhibits multiple self-consistent equilibria. An econometric version of the model is shown to be identified under relatively weka conditions. That analysis is extended to allow for general error distributions and some preliminary ways to account for the endogeneity of group memberships are developed.},
